## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Responsive design (mobile-first)
- Active & hover states
- Desktop-first enhancements
- Vanilla HTML/CSS

### What I learned

During this challenge, I practiced:

- Creating a clean, centered card layout using Flexbox
- Designing for different screen sizes with responsive units and media queries
- Applying interactive states (`:hover`, `:focus`, and `:active`) for better UX
- Using consistent color schemes and spacing

Here's a sample of a button interaction state I implemented:

css
.btn:hover,
.btn:focus {
  background-color: #c4f82a;
  color: #1f1f1f;
}

.btn:active {
  transform: scale(0.97);
  background-color: #a4d628;
}
